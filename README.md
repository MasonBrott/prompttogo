# PromptToGo

A terminal-based interactive prompt builder for Large Language Models (LLMs), built with [Huh?](https://github.com/charmbracelet/huh).

## Overview

Prompt To Go guides you through creating structured prompts for LLMs with clearly delineated sections:

- **Goal**: What you want the LLM to achieve
- **Return Format**: How you want the information returned
- **Warnings**: Things to be cautious about or to avoid
- **Context Dump**: Additional context or background information

The application provides an intuitive interface to fill in each section and previews the final formatted prompt that you can easily copy and paste. You can also save prompts to files for later use and load example prompts to get started quickly.
